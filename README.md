# UEFA Euro Statistics Dashboard

## Overview
This Tableau Dashboard showcases various statistics from the UEFA European Championship, covering categories such as top scorers, top appearances by players, youngest players to debut, quickest goals, and players with the most Euro titles. 

As an avid fan of the beautiful game, I went beyond the initial dataset and included additional data on the players' status (Active/Retired), the Euros each player participated in, and if they are currently participating in Euro 2024.

## Dashboard Features

- **Player Photos**: Players who won the Euros have a photo with the trophy, while others have photos of their celebrations.
- **Navigation Icons**: Easily navigate through different sections using the icons at the top.
- **Highlight on Spain**: The dashboard ends with players who won the most titles, highlighting the dominance of the Spanish team from 2008 to 2012.
